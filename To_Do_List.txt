    *   First make a blackjack game in python, check out programming-projects-for-n00bz github repo for the game
    *   Implement the blackjack game so it works in discord

        *   Make it so you type a slashcommand to start the game
        *   Have the game be in a function so you don't need to use slashcommands to continue
        *   Have it so the person that used the slashcommand, has his name saved and his messages get redirected to the game

    *   Later find out a way to put the discord_token in a .env file
    *   Find a way to hold the code running while me not being active
    *   Add ffmpeg support
        *   Need a ffmpeg library for python
        *   Can ask ProTDC for help or infomation
