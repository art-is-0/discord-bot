    X   First make a blackjack game in python, check out programming-projects-for-n00bz github repo for the game
    X   Implement the blackjack game so it works in discord

        X   Make it so you type a slashcommand to start the game
        X   Have the game be in a function so you don't need to use slashcommands to continue
        X   Fix the response system
        X   Using buttons for hit or stand
        X   Fix the visuals, kinda done, at the beginnning and end of the card command use ``, to make it into code and more viewable in discord
            ?   Maybe try to use embeds when the message is sent, does not look good
            
        X   Add more time between each send, using asyncio.sleep()
        X   Make the code more readable and add descriptions

    *   Put the slash commands in cogs
        *   Sync the damn code to discord
    X   Later find out a way to put the discord_token in a .env file
    *   Find a way to hold the code running while me not being active
    *   Add ffmpeg support
        *   Need a ffmpeg library for python
        *   Can ask ProTDC for help or infomation
